## Hi There, 
my name is Syed Hasnain Mehadi and I'm a MERN stack developer with 3 years of experience. I have a strong foundation in JavaScript and a deep understanding of the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.

Throughout my career, I've worked on a variety of projects, ranging from small applications to large-scale web applications. I have experience in designing and implementing RESTful APIs, creating responsive and interactive user interfaces with React, and integrating front-end components with back-end services using Node.js and Express.

I'm also proficient in database design and management using MongoDB, including data modeling, query optimization, and data migration. I have experience working with authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as JWT and OAuth.

I'm always eager to learn new technologies and stay up-to-date with the latest trends in web development. I'm a team player and enjoy collaborating with designers, product owners, and other developers to create successful products.
